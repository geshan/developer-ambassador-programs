# Developer ambassador programs

A list of developer ambassador programs run by various companies.

## What is a developer ambassador program?

A developer ambassador program is a program run by a company to promote its products or services by representatives (but not employees) of that organization. You as a member of any developer ambassador program are expected to produce technical content in the form of:

* text (blog posts)
* audio (podcasts)
* video (YouTube videos)
* public speaking (talks at meetups or conferences), and
* open source contribution to relevant repositories.

### Benefits of joining a developer ambassador program

Those contributions are not paid but you might get other benefits for doing it. The benefits might include

* recognition and personal branding
* access to features of products and services before the general users
* cover travel and/or accommodation to events where you speak about the company's products
* special or free access to the company's products or services
* credits to use the company's products or services
