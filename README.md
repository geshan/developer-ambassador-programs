# Developer ambassador programs

A list of developer ambassador programs run by various companies.

## What is a developer ambassador program?

A developer ambassador program is a program a company runs to promote its products or services by that organization's representatives (but not employees). You, as a member of any developer ambassador program, are expected to produce technical content in the form of:

* text (blog posts)
* audio (podcasts)
* video (YouTube videos)
* public speaking (talks at meetups or conferences)
* Open source contribution to relevant repositories, and
* helping the community by commenting or answering questions on platforms like StackOverflow

### Benefits of joining a developer ambassador program

Those contributions are not paid, but you might get other benefits from doing it. The benefits might include

* recognition and personal branding
* access to features of products and services before the general public
* invitation and access to the company's special or developer events
* cover travel and/or accommodation to events where you speak about the company's products
* special or free access to the company's products or services
* credits to use the company's products or services
